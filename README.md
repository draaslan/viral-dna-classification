# Human and Virus DNA Classification with TensorFlow 2

In this notebook, we will classify human and viral DNA with Deep Learning using TensorFlow 2. At the end of this tutorial, our model will reach approximately 90% accuracy. 

We will follow ViraMiner [paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222271) and [code](https://github.com/NeuroCSUT/ViraMiner) which is published by **Vicente R. et.al.** You can access the original article and source code. I have made some updates to the original code for educational purposes.

- Updated code base from Python 2 to Python 3.
- Added modules like pandas and removed plain Python code for I/O.
- Used single model.

## Dataset

## TODO
- Detailed explanation about genetics will be added.
- More model alternatives will be added.
